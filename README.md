## LordRAT :shipit:

### How it works :
The commands of the Trojan and the sender are encrypted with a common key to reduce the possibility of eavesdropping, and then connect to the target server using the entered information.


------

### General instructions for use:
Run the tool, then use the generator to create an executable file for the victim's system and save the decryption key in a safe place.
Now enter the launcher section and enter the requested information so that the launcher connects to the victim's system and that's it.

**NOTE**: Try not to enter commands that cause the program to crash, for example: Commands that ask the user to enter something and such commands.

------

### Usage :
```
git clone https://github.com/AdolfMacro/lordRAT.git
cd lordRAT
